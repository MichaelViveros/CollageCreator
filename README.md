CollageCreator
==============

CollageCreator uses scripting to automate the process of creating a collage. It is a plugin for the [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) Image Manipulation program written in the Scheme functional programming language.

To create collages: <br>
1. Download [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/downloads/). <br>
2. Place create-collage.scm into the default folder for GIMP scripts (Ex. "C:\\Users\\Mike\\.gimp-2.8\\scripts"). <br>
3. Update the parameters to the create-collage function in CollageCreator.bat and then run it. <br>

Usage: <br>
create-collage files-in out-path num-rows num-cols num-collages

files-in = the input pictures <br>
out-path = directory where collages will be saved <br>
num-rows = number of rows in the collage <br>
num-cols = number of columns in the collage  <br>
num-collages = number of collages to create

Example to create 2 3x3 collages of pictures from a trip to Mexico: <br>
create-collage \\"C:\\\Users\\\Mike\\\Pictures\\\Mexico\\\*.jpg\\" \\"C:\\\Users\\\Mike\\\Pictures\\\Mexico\\\\\" 3 3 2
<br>
